// -------------------------------- shareIn --------------------------------

/**
 * Converts a _cold_ [Flow] into a _hot_ [SharedFlow] that is started in the given coroutine [scope],
 * sharing emissions from a single running instance of upstream flow with multiple downstream subscribers,
 * and replaying a specified number of [replay] values to new subscribers. See [SharedFlow] documentation
 * on a general concepts of shared flows.
 *
 * Start of the sharing coroutine is controlled by the [started] parameter. By default, the sharing coroutine is started
 * [Eagerly][SharingStarted.Eagerly], so upstream flow is started even before the first subscribers appears and all
 * the values emitted by upstream beyond the specified [replay] parameter **will be immediately discarded**.
 * Additional options for [started] parameter are:
 *
 * * [Lazily][SharingStarted.Lazily] &mdash; starts the upstream flow after the first subscriber appears, which guarantees
 *   that this first subscriber gets all the emitted values, while subsequence subscribers are only guaranteed to
 *   get the most recent [replay] values. The upstream flow continues to be active even when all subscribers
 *   disappear and only the most recent [replay] values are stored without subscribers.
 * * [WhileSubscribed()][SharingStarted.WhileSubscribed] &mdash; starts the upstream flow when the first subscriber
 *   appears, immediately stops when the last subscriber disappears, keeping the replay cache forever.
 *   It has additional optional configuration parameters as explained in its documentation.
 * * Custom strategy can be supplied by implementing [SharingStarted] interface.
 *
 * `shareIn` operator is useful in situations when there is a _cold_ flow that is expensive to create and/or
 * to maintain but there are multiple subscribers that need to collect its values. For example, consider a
 * flow of messages coming from a backend over the expensive network connection, taking a lot of
 * time to establish. Conceptually it might be implemented like this:
 *
 * ```
 * val backendMessages: Flow<Message> = flow {
 *     connectToBackend() // takes a lot of time
 *     try {
 *       while (true) {
 *           emit(receiveMessageFromBackend())
 *       }
 *     } finally {
 *         disconnectFromBackend()
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * If this flow is directly used in the application, then every time it is collected a fresh connection is
 * established and it will take a while before messages start flowing. However, we can share a single connection
 * and establish it eagerly like this:
 *
 * ```
 * val messages: SharedFlow<Message> = backendMessages.shareIn(scope, 0)
 * ```
 *
 * Now, a single connection is shared between all collectors from `messages` and there is a chance that the connection
 * is already established by the time it is needed.
 *
 * ### Error handling
 *
 * Any exception in the upstream flow terminates the sharing coroutine without affecting any of the subscribers
 * and will be handled by the [scope] in which the sharing coroutine is launched. Custom exception handling
 * can be configured by using [catch] or [retry] operators before `shareIn` operator.
 * For example, to retry connection on any `IOException` with 1 second delay between attempts use:
 *
 * ```
 * val messages = backendMessages
 *     .retry { e ->
 *         val shallRetry = e is IOException // other exception are bugs - handle them
 *         if (shallRetry) delay(1000)
 *         shallRetry
 *     }
 *     .shareIn(scope, 0)
 * ```
 *
 * ### Buffering and conflation
 *
 * The `shareIn` operator runs upstream flow in a separate coroutine and buffers emissions from upstream as explained
 * in [buffer] operator description using a buffer of [replay] size or the default (whichever is larger).
 * This default buffering can be overridden with an explicit buffer configuration by preceding `shareIn` call
 * with [buffer] or [conflate], for example:
 *
 * * `buffer(0).shareIn(scope, 0)` &mdash; overrides a default buffer size and creates a [SharedFlow] without a buffer.
 *   Effectively, it configures sequential processing between upstream emitter and subscribers,
 *   as emitter is suspended until all subscribers process the value. Note, that the value is still immediately
 *   discarded when there are no subscribers.
 * * `buffer(b).shareIn(scope, r)` &mdash; creates a [SharedFlow] with `replay = r` and `extraBufferCapacity = b`.
 * * `conflate().shareIn(scope, r)` &mdash; creates a [SharedFlow] with `replay = r`, `onBufferOverflow = KEEP_LATEST`,
 *   and `extraBufferCapacity = 1` when `replay == 0` to support this strategy.
 *
 * ### Operator fusion
 *
 * Application of [flowOn][Flow.flowOn], [buffer] with [RENDEZVOUS][Channel.RENDEZVOUS] capacity,
 * or [cancellable] operators to the resulting shared flow has no effect.
 *
 * ### Exceptions
 *
 * This function throws [IllegalArgumentException] on unsupported values of parameters of combinations thereof.
 *
 * @param scope the coroutine scope in which sharing is started.
 * @param replay the number of values replayed to new subscribers (cannot be negative).
 * @param started the strategy that controls when sharing is started and stopped
 *   (optional, default to [Eagerly][SharingStarted.Eagerly] starting the sharing without waiting for subscribers).
 * @param initialValue the initial value in the replay cache (optional, defaults to nothing, supported only when `replay > 0`).
 *   This value is also used when shared flow buffer is reset using [SharingStarted.WhileSubscribed] strategy
 *   with `replayExpirationMillis` parameter.
